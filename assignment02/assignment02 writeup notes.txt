1. what question(s) you investigated.

 - how are different methods affected by context word frequency

2. what words you tested, and how you decided on those words.

 - hold the count of co-occurrences 
 - keep the count of target words in a relatively small range
 - incrementally increase the count of the context word
 - repeat this method for three chunks spanning the dataset

3. what methods you compared. You do not need to describe (P)PMI or cosine similarity, but you should include a brief description of whatever other methods you chose.

 - ppmi with alpha smoothing (context distribution smoothing)
	- alleviates poi's bias towards rare words by increasing the probability of of sampling a rare context which
 - Dunning log likelihood ratio 

4. how you analyzed the results and what you concluded.

5. the output of the program after you have completed the Preliminary Task
